# What is Sheltered-save-converter?

Sheltered-save-converter is an open-source command-line utility written in C++ specifically designed to encrypt/decrypt [Sheltered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheltered_(video_game)) save files


the usage is simple (and program will remind you if you don't enter enough argumments)
```cmd
Sheltered_save_file_converter.exe SAVE_FILE CONVERTED_SAVE_FILE
```
> also, a batch file was provided for those that don't like/know how to use command line, just drag and drop your save file into the .BAT file located along the program.


this tool was created as a workaround to the issues regarding the [original javascrypt file](https://jsfiddle.net/mjnpr2ac/18/) used by the sheltered comunity to do this conversion




## what can i use this tool for?
to decrypt your game save file into xml format, allowing you to edit/see the save 

users usually want this to do some cheating (take a look at the M16 Hatch code & enable it for example)
